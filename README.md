Welcome to my EComm API. It is set up like an online store for customers to
view a product catalog and make purchases. The NavBar.jsx creates the navigation
bar at the top of the page which allows the user to navigate the website. 
Homepage.jsx simply takes the user home. New customers are added via the 
NewCustomer.jsx file and Customers.jsx allows one to view all existing customers
and their info. 

NewProducts.jsx allows one to add a new product to the catolog
for one to order and the entire catalog with details of each individual product
is seen via Products.jsx. NewOrders.jsx allows a user to place a new order by
entering their customerID, the product ID of what they wish to purchase, and the
date they are ordering the product.

Product ID's are used to place orders as 
many products can be similar in name and/or details. The product ID 
distinguishes each individual product in order to maximize order accuracy. The 
App.jsx puts it all together to create what is viewed on the web page.
